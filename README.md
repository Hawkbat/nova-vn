# Nova VN

Nova VN is a browser-based engine for visual-novel-style experiences.

## Developer Notes

The code for this project primarily lives in the inaccurately-named `docs` folder, in order to take advantage of the GitHub Pages feature that allows for publishing static sites from the `docs` folder of a repository.

The engine is designed to be used either as static files served by a traditional website, such as GitHub Pages or another web host, or it can be downloaded and executed as a native app, powered by the [Neutralinojs framework](https://neutralino.js.org/).
