== SHORT-TERM ==

Multi-outfit support is confusing, not sure how to help

Make error messages more descriptive to describe what the user should try to fix it
Variable interpolation in strings, like "You ate $cookieCount cookies"
Autocomplete is broken in some contexts, need to debug
Change editor tooling to use file line state instead of scanning for character IDs for context

== MEDIUM-TERM ==

Document all commands and what they do, and surface that as both a "cheat sheet" document and in-app as hover and signature documentation
Variable state inspector in editor
Story metadata
    Possibly as directives in story.nvn?
    Should they be able to be changed in passages (like title?)
        Maybe just subtitles/save titles
Save files (save and load story state, export/import)
"Rewind" to previous story states
Fast forward/skip
    Could have options to fast-forward through choices and through passages previously rewinded through

== LONG-TERM ==

Can we defer character identifier validation for character actions? Maybe if we can exhaustively eliminate the list of other actions first
